15.0 Bot Protection Instructions
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to the version 15.0 bot protection instructions. There are two sections in this guide part:

15.0 Guided Condifugration profile creation
-------------------------------------------------

This is the documentation for configuring a bot protection profile via the guided configuration utility.

    a. Select the "Security" menu item on the left hand side of your Big-IP admin GUI and then select "Guided Configuration":

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.1.png

    b. Click on the "Web Application Protection" button and then on the newly displayed "Bot Protection" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.2.png

    c. An overview page is displayed for the Bot Protection guided configuration; click the "Next" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.3.png

    d. Give the configuration a name, leave the policy transparent, relaxed and challenge free. Ensure you set all Mitigation settings to "Alarm" and then click the "Save and Next" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.4.png

    e. Assign the virtual server(s) that you want to apply the policy to and click the "Save and Next" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.5.png

    f. Check your settings and then click the "Deploy" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.6.png

    g. Once your configuration is deployed, you will get a message saying it's completed - click the "Finish" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.7.png

Your Bot Protection profile has now been successfully put in place with non intrusing (signature matching only) detections and transparent mitigation mode (alarming/alerting only).

Navigate to each virtual server configured via the Guided Configuration in turn, and click the "Security" drop down and select "Policies".

You will see that the guided configuration has aplied the newly created bot profile to your virtual server:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.12.png

While you are in this area, scroll to the bottom of the configuration screen to the "Log Profile" section. Locate the "local-bot-defense" log profile, click the left arrows to move the profile from "Available" to "Selected" and then click the "update" button:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.13.png

To see what bot traffic is being picked up by your Big-IP, click on "security" -> "Event Logs" -> "Bot Defense" -> "Bot Traffic":

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.8.png

Your events dashboard will start to show results over time, here is an example of my simple magento site being targeted by bots. 

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.9.png

Note that "No Action" are legitimate human interactions and "Alarm" are all of the logging only events. There are no denied requests because we are operating in transparent mode; i.e.: not blocking. 

As you get insight into the automated attacks targeting your organisation's applications, it is an easy matter of changing the policy type from transparent to blocking:

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.10.png

And the Bot "Mitigation Settings" for, as an example, "Malicious Bots" from "Alarm" to "Block":

    .. image:: ./images/15.0.a.11.png

This concludes the guided configuration instructions. For questions, advice, etc. please:

15.0 Manual profile creation
-------------------------------------------

I was going to write this up - and probably will in the future, but really - I mean REALLY! - do yourself a favour and use the guided configuration.
